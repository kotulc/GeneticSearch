# GeneticSearch
Performs an evolutionary search of the defined ESN parameter space

This C++ project depends on the included Eigen 3.2.7 library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and successfully builds in Visual Studio Express 2013 on a 64bit Windows 10 machine. All included files and source code are freely available for public and private use.

The project was developed from 10/13 to 1/14 and was originally intended as a means for exploring several concepts including Evolutionary Search, Echo State Networks, and Reservoir Computing. This project was also useful for practicing coding in C++, creating a  Multi-threaded application, and utilizing Matrix algebra and related concepts. Due to the exploritory nature of this project it was not intended for publication or distribution to a wider audience, lacks helpful documentation, and is in a pre-release but functional state.
